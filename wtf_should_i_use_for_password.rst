Some time ago I *invented* a password *generator* that fits into a tweet:

In time I tweaked the code a bit and got tired of copying it from, erm, Wunderlist and pasting it into iTerm to get a random password so today I sat down and wrapped it in a tiny Flask app.

Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm proud to announce `What The Fuck Should I Use For Password? <http://whatthefuckshouldiuseforpassword.com/>`_ - a Web 2.0 (?) app that'll change your life once for all :).

PS. Remember, kids - `bad words are bad <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC0MmJHFdAg>`_.
