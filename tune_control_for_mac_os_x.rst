tune-control is a tiny command line program for Mac OS X that makes controlling iTunes or Spotify from shell a walk in a park. I wrote it because I often find myself working remotely on my MacBook and I need a way to control Spotify without physical access to the machine.

The program is dead simple, e.g.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ tune-control play

will start playing (or unpause) the current track.

For more info see `the app's page <http://tomekwojcik.github.com/tune-control/>`_ on GitHub.

So, if you'd like to give it a try grab the source `here <https://github.com/tomekwojcik/tune-control/>`_ or `the binary (Intel-only) <http://cdn.bthlabs.pl/tune-control-1.0.zip>`_.

PS. This is probably the stupidest piece of software I've written in the recent months :).
