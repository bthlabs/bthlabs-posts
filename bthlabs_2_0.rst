.. excerpt:: Announcing BTHLabs 2.0!

The all-new BTHLabs has landed. Here's a quick look at the changes.

**New design**

The site has been redesigned by `Mateusz Dembek <http://dembsky.me/>`_. The new
design is even more minimalistic than the previous one and matches the general
"brand" identification (which was also designed by Mateusz).

**New blog engine**

The site has been migrated from Posterous to its own engine. It's a Jekyll-like
system, which generates static HTML files from reStructuredText sources. The
project is currently in prototype stage and I'll be working on tweaking and
extending it with end of April as deadline for release on GitHub.

Links to Posterous posts are preserved and (where possible) redirect to new
posts.

**BTHLabs on GitHub**

Speaking of GitHub, BTHLabs has now
`it's own profile <https://github.com/bthlabs>`_. From now on, all the projects
I describe here will be published via BTHLabs' profile on GitHub. Also, sources
for blog posts will be published there.

That's pretty much it. Thanks for stopping by :).
