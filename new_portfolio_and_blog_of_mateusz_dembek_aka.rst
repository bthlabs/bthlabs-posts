My fellow designer, Mateusz Dembek (aka `@dembsky <https://twitter.com/dembsky>`_) asked me to code his redesigned portfolio and blog. Today the work is done and the site has gone live. You can see it at `dembsky.me <http://dembsky.me/>`_.

The site's design is awesome and coding it was a pure pleasure. Working with Mateusz's designs is a great experience.

If you like Mateusz's work follow him on Twitter and Dribbble.
