A small list of websites providing designers and webmasters with placeholder images. My personal favorite, `PlaceKitten <http://placekitten.com/>`_, has been joined by `SheenHolders <http://sheenholders.com/>`_ :). If you're looking for something serious I recommend `lorempixum <http://lorempixum.com/>`_ as they provide high-quality, SFW and categorized images.

`See the article <http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/the-top-8-placeholders-for-web-designers/>`_
